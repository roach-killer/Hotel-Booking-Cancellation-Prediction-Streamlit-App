            ### Count of Booking Status by Lead Time Range

            The titled graph illustrates the number of bookings made across various lead time ranges, categorized based on booking status (canceled or not canceled).

            **Key Takeaways**

            - Examining the graph reveals that a substantial portion of bookings occur within 0-3 months of the guest's arrival date. This pattern aligns with the tendency of individuals to book their accommodations closer to their travel dates, allowing for more flexibility in case of unforeseen circumstances. Notably, a significant number of bookings are made further in advance, particularly within the 3-6 months and 6-9 months ranges. This indicates that some guests meticulously plan their trips well ahead of time and may secure their accommodations early to avail of favorable rates or ensure availability.

            - Interestingly, the graph highlights that a higher percentage of cancellations occur within the 6-9 months and 3-6 months lead time ranges. This trend could be attributed to various factors, including alterations in travel plans, budgetary constraints, or unexpected events.

                - **Price Range Distribution:** Analyzing the graph reveals that the most prevalent price range for bookings falls within the 50-100 range, accounting for approximately 40% of the total bookings. This suggests that a considerable portion of guests seek accommodations within this moderate price bracket. Following closely, the 100-199 price range holds a significant share of bookings, representing around 33% of the total. This indicates that a notable number of guests are willing to invest in slightly higher-priced accommodations.
